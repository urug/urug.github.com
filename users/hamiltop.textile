Peter Hamilton seems to do everything.

His "Blog":http://undiscoveredfeatures.com has everything from hardware hacks to art pieces.

"Google+":https://plus.google.com/u/0/112306339882355338783/ is his preferred social media.

And though he codes in Ruby for a living, he still loves a good bithack in C.
